## 3-Setup

### 1. Get your API Token (custom branding only)

Go to [@BotFather](https://t.me/botfather) on Telegram, create a new bot and get your \*\*API Token. \*\*

**We need this to connect our engine & your telegram bot, that's why we ask to create a dedicated bot for this.** _Additionnal costs apply for white-labeled bots, contact the team for more informations._

👉 **If you choose to use the native SlopAI branding, we only need your Telegram group ID **to connect it to our engine.\
It’s that simple — **plug & play**. Your **SlopAI bot will be live in your group within 10 minutes after the demo & payment**.

### 2. Sync & Demo

Join our [Telegram Group](https://t.me/slopification) for a "Live Demo." We will manually sync your token logo/mascot with our engine (or your bot if you want to create your own bot branded with your mascott). Demo will take place in our group to prevent abuse from your community.

- The bot must be added as an **Admin** in your group.
- A 5 minutes live demo is activated immediately.

### 3. Unlock Credits

Once the demo ends, you decide if you want the bot for your group. Contact [@itsbullishnow](https://t.me/itsbullishnow) to unlock your generation credits.  

<Note>
  By default, the [Slop AI Bot](https://t.me/slopai_bot) is configured with a **50-second Rate Limit** to maintain chat readability.
