## **1. Setup** 

### Option A : Native SlopAI Bot (recommended)

If you choose to use the **native SlopAI branding**, we only need your **Telegram group ID** to connect it to our engine.

That’s it — **no bot to create, no setup on your side**.

👉 **Plug & play**. Your SlopAI bot will be live in your group within **10 minutes after the demo & payment**.

This option is ideal if you want to:

- get started fast
- avoid technical setup
- use the official SlopAI bot and branding

---

### Option B : Custom Branded Bot (white-label)

If you want your **own branded bot**, you’ll need to create a dedicated Telegram bot.

1. Go to **@BotFather** on Telegram
2. Create a new bot
3. Retrieve your **API Token**

We use this token to securely connect **your bot** to the SlopAI engine.

⚠️ **Additional costs apply** for white-labeled bots.\
For pricing and details, please **contact the team**.

## **<u>2. Sync & Demo</u>**

Join our [Telegram Group](https://t.me/slopification) for a "Live Demo." We will manually sync your token logo/mascot with our engine (or your bot if you want to create your own bot branded with your mascott). Demo will take place in our group to prevent abuse from your community.

- The bot must be added as an **Admin** in your group.
- A 5 minutes live demo is activated immediately.

## 3. Unlock Credits

Once the demo ends, you decide if you want the bot for your group. Contact [@itsbullishnow](https://t.me/itsbullishnow) to unlock your generation credits.

<Note>
  By default, the [Slop AI Bot](https://t.me/slopai_bot) is configured with a **50-second Rate Limit** to maintain chat readability.
